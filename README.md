# tei.xml2csv
BeautifulSoup code to extract metadata from TEI-conformant XML files and export to CSV file.

This project was created as part of the <a href="https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/leading/">2022 LEADING Fellowship</a> through Drexel University's <a href="https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/">Metadata Research Center (MRC)</a> for working with the <a href="https://schoenberginstitute.org/">Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies</a> at the <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak">Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts</a>, University of Pennsylvania Libraries.

The goal of the project was to contribute metadata records for medieval Scandinavian manuscripts from <a href="https://handrit.is/?lang=en">Handrit.is</a>, a joint electronic catalogue of holdings from several academic and national institutions, to the <a href="https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/">Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM)</a>, an open-access resource that aggregates observations of premodern manuscripts. 

The Handrit.is records are available via <a href="https://github.com/Handrit">GitHub repository</a> as <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html">TEI-conformant</a> XML files.
